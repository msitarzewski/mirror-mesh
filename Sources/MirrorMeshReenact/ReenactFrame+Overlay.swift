// =============================================================================
// ReenactFrame.overlayLipSync — mouth-region coefficient merge
// =============================================================================
//
// The v0.8.0 lip-sync overlay is the bridge between the audio-driven mouth
// shape produced by `MirrorMeshTranslate.LipSyncDriver` and the stylized 3D
// head puppet from v0.6.0. The pipeline calls this extension method once per
// frame, after `ReenactStage.apply(_:)` produces the operator-driven frame.
//
// **Contract**:
//   • Replaces ONLY the mouth-region coefficients (the keys listed in
//     `MirrorMeshTranslate.LipSyncCoefficients.mouthShapeKeys`, mirrored here
//     as `mouthShapeKeysForOverlay`). Pose channels (headYaw/Pitch/Roll) and
//     non-mouth blendshapes (brow*, eyeClose*, cheekPuff*, noseSneer) pass
//     through untouched.
//   • Re-deforms the mesh from the merged coefficient set using the model's
//     existing `deform(coefficients:)` and `computeNormals(vertices:)`. This
//     keeps the geometry consistent with the rest of the rig — the same code
//     path that handled the operator-driven solve handles the audio overlay.
//   • Preserves frameID / hostTimeNs / labelTextureIndex / indices so the
//     downstream renderer doesn't notice anything changed structurally.
//
// **Why on `ReenactFrame`, not inside `FaceReenactor`**: the merge is pure —
// no identity gating, no async state. The reenactor's actor isolation exists
// for identity hot-swap; the merge happens on the pipeline's executor and is
// a no-cost extension on a value type.
//
// **Why a mouth-shape allow-list, not a "replace all" merge**: the operator's
// silent face still controls everything above the mouth (brows raised in
// surprise, eyes squinting, head tilted). Replacing only the explicit mouth
// keys is what makes the avatar look like *the operator* speaking a foreign
// language, instead of a generic puppet.
